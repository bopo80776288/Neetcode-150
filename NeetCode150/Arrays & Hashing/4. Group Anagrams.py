# Key Takeaway Notes:
# Dictionaries are unhashable, so they cannot be used as keys.
# If they were hashable, order wouldnâ€™t matter (they compare based on key-value pairs).
# Tuples are ordered, so different key orders result in different keys.
# Sorting dict.items() ensures a consistent tuple representation, preventing unordered dictionary keys from causing incorrect anagram groupings.
# In this case we want to avoid sorting so we use a [0] * 26 list instead
# Converting the list to a tuple (tuple(count)) makes it hashable, allowing it to be used as a key in wordhash.
